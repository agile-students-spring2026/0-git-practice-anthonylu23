This study raises an important question for developers: does relying on AI tools hurt our ability to learn? The research found that heavy AI users scored about 17% lower on comprehension tests: roughly two letter grades. However, developers who asked follow-up questions and tried to understand the generated code performed much better. The takeaway is that the struggle of debugging and working through problems on your own is where real skill development happens. As AI becomes more integrated into development workflows, it's worth being intentional about when to use it and when to work through challenges independently.
